# CHIP-8 Emulator
This project was my first dive into emulation, and my first independent C project. The emulator reads in a ROM to memory and decodes each instruction one by one. I've tested a couple of games with this emulator, my favorite is called Glitch Ghost.

# How to Run
This program must be executed on Linux, or through WSL. Execute the build/Debug/main from the main CHIP-8 directory, or wherever you decide to put the rom. The rom.ch8 file in the directory you execute from will be the one used.
